#### § 774.1 Introduction.

(a) _Scope of the control list._ In this part, references to the EAR are references to [15 CFR chapter VII](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-07-10/title-15/chapter-VII), subchapter C. The Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) maintains the Commerce Control List (CCL) that includes “items”—i.e., “commodities,” “software,” and “technology”—subject to the authority of BIS. The CCL does not include items exclusively controlled for export by another department or agency of the U.S. Government, though in instances where other agencies administer controls over related items, entries in the CCL may contain a reference to such controls. In addition, those items “subject to the EAR” but not identified on the CCL are identified by the designator “EAR99.” See § 734.2(a) of the EAR for items that are “subject to the EAR.” EAR Part 738 contains an explanation of the organization of the CCL and its relationship to the Country Chart.

(b) _ECCN cross-references for items subject to exclusive jurisdiction of another agency._

(1) Prior to October 15, 2013, the CCL contained certain ECCNs that were only included as cross references to items subject to the export control regulations administered by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

(2) ECCNs formerly listed on the CCL that, as of October 15, 2013 were subject to the export licensing authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission at [10 CFR part 110](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-07-10/title-10/part-110) are: 0A001, 0B001, 0B002, 0B003, 0B004, 0B005, 0B006, 0C001, 0C002, 0C004, 0C005, 0C006, 0C201 and 1C012.

(3) The following multilateral export control regime reference is provided, as an additional point of historical reference: 0C201—INFCIRC 254 Part 1, 5.3.1(b).

ECCNs 0D001 and 0E001 are “subject to the ITAR” (see [22 CFR parts 120](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-07-10/title-22/part-120) through [130](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-07-10/title-22/part-130)). These ECCNs are retained on the CCL as cross references to the ITAR, although the former cross references to export licensing authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (see [10 CFR part 110](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-07-10/title-10/part-110)) for ECCN 0D001, and to the Department of Energy (see [10 CFR part 810](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-07-10/title-10/part-810)) for 0E001 were removed from the Control(s) paragraph in the License Requirements section of these two ECCNs and added as a more general jurisdictional cross reference in a heading note added to these two ECCNs as of June 5, 2014.

(c) _Where to find the CCL?_ The CCL is contained in supplement no. 1 to this part, and supplement no. 2 to this part contains the General Technology and Software Notes relevant to entries contained in the CCL.

(d) _Conventions related to the use of quotation marks on the CCL._ The use of double quotation marks on the CCL is intended to be an aid to alert you to terms used on the CCL that are defined in part 772 (Definitions of Terms), or for purposes of ECCNs, where a definition is provided in the “related definitions” paragraph in the License Requirements section of ECCNs or sometimes in Notes and Technical Notes for particular ECCNs and that definition is specific to that particular ECCN. In this sense the quotes are helpful both in the use of single and double quotes, but a good compliance practice is to familiarize yourself with the defined terms in part 772, and when reviewing a control parameter on the CCL that uses a term that is not in quotes to be aware it may be defined in part 772. It is also a useful compliance practice to review the “Related Definitions” paragraph and Notes and Technical Notes to determine if the term is defined for purposes of a particular ECCN.

(1) _Use of double quotes._ If a term on the CCL uses double quotes it means there is a defined term in part 772. However, the absence of double quotes does not mean that a term used on the CCL is not defined in part 772. Because the CCL includes many terms that are defined in part 772, BIS's practice is to use double quotes for certain key terms and to use double quotes when needed for consistency with multilateral export control regime based entries, such as many derived from control lists, in particular for the Wassenaar Arrangement that also uses the double quotes convention. However, because of the large number of defined terms used on the CCL and a desire to avoid hindering readability by placing quotes around too many words used in particular ECCNs, BIS's practice is to not add double quotes around certain terms, such as items and commodities. This convention also applies to the use of double quotes within the Definition of Terms section under part 772.

(2) _Use of single quotes._ The CCL also includes a convention regarding the use of single quotes. Single quotes on the CCL identify a term as a defined term in the context of a particular ECCN. This convention also applies to the use of single quotes within the Definition of Terms section under part 772.

(e) _Chemicals identified by Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) number._ In some instances chemicals are listed by name and CAS number. The list applies to chemicals of the same structural formula (including hydrates) regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying a particular chemical or mixture, irrespective of nomenclature. CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers because some forms of the listed chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a listed chemical may also have different CAS numbers.

_Frames (receivers) under 0A501.e refers to any “part” or “component” of the firearm that has or is customarily marked with a serial number when required by law. This paragraph 0A501.e is synonymous with a “part” or “component” that is regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (see [18 U.S.C. 921(a)(3)](https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/18/921); [27 CFR parts 447](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-07-10/title-27/part-447), [478](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-07-10/title-27/part-478), and [479](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-07-10/title-27/part-479),) as a firearm._

_Frames (receivers) “specially designed” for semi-automatic firearms are controlled under ECCN 0A509.b or .c._

f. through w. \[Reserved\]

x. “Parts” and “components” that are “specially designed” for a commodity classified under paragraphs .a through .c of this entry, a commodity classified under ECCNs 0A506 or 0A507, or the USML and not elsewhere specified on the USML or CCL or controlled under ECCN 0A509.

y. Specific “parts,” “components,” “accessories” and “attachments” “specially designed” for a commodity subject to control in this ECCN, ECCNs 0A506, 0A507, or common to a defense article in USML Category I and not elsewhere specified in the USML or CCL as follows, and “parts,” “components,” “accessories,” and “attachments” “specially designed” therefor.

y.6. Bayonets; and

y.7. Firearms manufactured from 1890 to 1898 and reproductions thereof.

_ECCN 0A501 includes “parts” and “components” that are not “subject to the ITAR” even though they are common to firearms described in ECCN 0A501 and to those firearms “subject to the ITAR.”_

_A receiver with any other controlled “part” or “component” (e.g., a barrel (0A501.c), or trigger guard (0A501.x), or stock (0A501.y.1)) is still controlled under 0A501.e._

_Antique firearms i.e., those manufactured before 1890) and reproductions thereof, muzzle loading and black powder firearms except those designs based on centerfire weapons of a post 1937 design, BB guns, pellet rifles, paint ball, and all other air rifles are EAR99 commodities._

_Muzzle loading and black powder firearms with a caliber less than 20 mm that were manufactured post 1937 that are used for hunting or sporting purposes that were not “specially designed” for military use and are not described on the USML nor controlled as shotguns under ECCN 0A502 are EAR99 commodities._

_Scope mounts or accessory rails, iron sights, sling swivels, and butt plates or recoil pads that are subject to the EAR are designated as EAR99. These commodities have been determined to no longer warrant being “specially designed” for purposes of ECCN 0A501._

_A kit, including a replacement or repair kit, of firearms “parts” or “components” customarily sold and exported together takes on the classification of the most restrictive “part” or “component” that is included in the kit. For example, a kit containing 0A501.y and .x “parts,” is controlled as a 0A501.x kit because the .x “part” is the most restrictive “part” included in the kit. A complete 0A501 firearm disassembled in a kit form is controlled as a firearm under 0A501.a, .b, or .y.7._

_1\. The word initiator or igniter is sometimes used in place of the word detonator._

_2\. For the purposes of 1A007.b, the detonators of concern all utilize a small electrical conductor (bridge, bridge wire, or foil) that explosively vaporizes when a fast, high-current electrical pulse is passed through it. In non slapper types, the exploding conductor starts a chemical detonation in a contacting high explosive material such as PETN (pentaerythritoltetranitrate). In slapper detonators, the explosive vaporization of the electrical conductor drives a flyer or slapper across a gap, and the impact of the slapper on an explosive starts a chemical detonation. The slapper in some designs is driven by magnetic force. The term exploding foil detonator may refer to either an EB or a slapper-type detonator._

License Requirements

_Reason for Control:_ CB, CW, AT

| Control(s) | Country chart<br>(see supp. No. 1<br>to part 738) |
| --- | --- |
| CB applies to entire entry CB Column 2. |

CW applies to 1C350.b and .c. The Commerce Country Chart is not designed to determine licensing requirements for items controlled for CW reasons. A license is required, for CW reasons, to export or reexport Schedule 2 chemicals and mixtures identified in 1C350.b to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR). A license is required, for CW reasons, to export Schedule 3 chemicals and mixtures identified in 1C350.c to States not Party to the CWC, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country has been obtained by the exporter prior to export. A license is required, for CW reasons, to reexport Schedule 3 chemicals and mixtures identified in 1C350.c from a State not Party to the CWC to any other State not Party to the CWC. (See § 742.18 of the EAR for license requirements and policies for toxic and precursor chemicals controlled for CW reasons. See § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements that apply to exports of Schedule 3 chemicals to countries not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR.)

AT applies to entire entry. The Commerce Country Chart is not designed to determine licensing requirements for items controlled for AT reasons in 1C350. A license is required, for AT reasons, to export or reexport items controlled by 1C350 to a country in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR. (See part 742 of the EAR for additional information on the AT controls that apply to Iran, North Korea, and Syria. See part 746 of the EAR for additional information on sanctions that apply to Iran, North Korea, and Syria.)

_1\. SAMPLE SHIPMENTS: Subject to the following requirements and restrictions, a license is not required for sample shipments when the cumulative total of these shipments does not exceed a 55-gallon container or 200 kg of a single chemical to any one consignee during a calendar year. A consignee that receives a sample shipment under this exclusion may not resell, transfer, or reexport the sample shipment, but may use the sample shipment for any other legal purpose unrelated to chemical weapons._

_a. Chemicals Not Eligible_

_A. \[Reserved\]_

_B. CWC Schedule 2 chemicals (States not Party to the CWC). No CWC Schedule 2 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.b is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license._

_b. Countries Not Eligible: Countries in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR are not eligible to receive sample shipments of any chemicals controlled by this ECCN without a license._

_c. Sample shipments that require an End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.c is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country is obtained by the exporter prior to export (see § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements)._

_d. Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR._

_e. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.”_

_2\. MIXTURES:_

_a. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b through .d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs._

b. _A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR._

_Note to Mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals:_

_a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations;_

_b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents._

_3\. COMPOUNDS. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR._

_4\. TESTING KITS: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)_

_1\. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions._

_2\. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates._

_3\. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates, isotopically-labeled forms or all possible stereoisomers) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying whether a particular precursor chemical or mixture is controlled under ECCN 1C350, irrespective of nomenclature. However, CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers in all situations because some forms of the listed precursor chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a precursor chemical listed in ECCN 1C350 may also have different CAS numbers._

B. “Test”, “Inspection” and “Production Equipment”

_1\. Secondary parallel contouring axes, (e.g., the w-axis on horizontal boring mills or a secondary rotary axis the center line of which is parallel to the primary rotary axis) are not counted in the total number of contouring axes. Rotary axes need not rotate over 360°. A rotary axis can be driven by a linear device (e.g., a screw or a rack-and-pinion)._

_2\. The number of axes which can be coordinated simultaneously for “contouring control” is the number of axes along or around which, during processing of the workpiece, simultaneous and interrelated motions are performed between the workpiece and a tool. This does not include any additional axes along or around which other relative motions within the machine are performed, such as:_

_2.a. Wheel-dressing systems in grinding machines;_

_2.b. Parallel rotary axes designed for mounting of separate workpieces;_

_2.c. Co-linear rotary axes designed for manipulating the same workpiece by holding it in a chuck from different ends._

_3\. Axis nomenclature shall be in accordance with International Standard ISO 841:2001, Industrial automation systems and integration—Numerical control of machines—Coordinate system and motion nomenclature._

_4\. A “tilting spindle” is counted as a rotary axis._

_5\. 'Stated “unidirectional positioning repeatability” ' may be used for each specific machine model as an alternative to individual machine tests, and is determined as follows:_

_5.a. Select five machines of a model to be evaluated;_

_5.b. Measure the linear axis repeatability (R↑,R↓) according to ISO 230-2:2014 and evaluate “unidirectional positioning repeatability” for each axis of each of the five machines;_

_5.c. Determine the arithmetic mean value of the ”unidirectional positioning repeatability”-values for each axis of all five machines together. These arithmetic mean values “unidirectional positioning repeatability” (UPR) become the stated value of each axis for the model...) (UPR_ X _, UPR_ y _, . . .);_

_5.d. Since the Category 2 list refers to each linear axis there will be as many 'stated “unidirectional positioning repeatability” ' values as there are linear axes;_

_5.e. If any axis of a machine model not controlled by 2B001.a. to 2B001.c. has a 'stated “unidirectional positioning repeatability” ' equal to or less than the specified “unidirectional positioning repeatability” of each machine tool model plus 0.7 µm, the builder should be required to reaffirm the accuracy level once every eighteen months._

_6\. For the purpose of 2B, measurement uncertainty for the “unidirectional positioning repeatability” of machine tools, as defined in the International Standard ISO 230-2:2014, shall not be considered._

_7\. For the purpose of 2B, the measurement of axes shall be made according to test procedures in 5.3.2. of ISO 230-2:2014. Tests for axes longer than 2 meters shall be made over 2 m segments. Axes longer than 4 m require multiple tests (e.g., two tests for axes longer than 4 m and up to 8 m, three tests for axes longer than 8 m and up to 12 m), each over 2 m segments and distributed in equal intervals over the axis length. Test segments are equally spaced along the full axis length, with any excess length equally divided at the beginning, in between, and at the end of the test segments. The smallest “unidirectional positioning repeatability”-value of all test segments is to be reported._

_Processes specified in Column 1 of the Table are defined as follows:_

_a. Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) is an overlay coating or surface modification coating process wherein a metal, alloy, “composite”, dielectric or ceramic is deposited upon a heated substrate. Gaseous reactants are decomposed or combined in the vicinity of a substrate resulting in the deposition of the desired elemental, alloy or compound material on the substrate. Energy for this decomposition or chemical reaction process may be provided by the heat of the substrate, a glow discharge plasma, or “laser” irradiation._

_Note 1: CVD includes the following processes: Directed gas flow out-of-pack deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal decomposition (CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD processes_.

_Note 2: Pack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture._

_Note 3: The gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process are produced using the same basic reactions and parameters as the pack cementation process, except that the substrate to be coated is not in contact with the powder mixture._

_b. Thermal Evaporation-Physical Vapor Deposition (TE-PVD) is an overlay coating process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure less than 0.1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is used to vaporize the coating material. This process results in the condensation, or deposition, of the evaporated species onto appropriately positioned substrates. The addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during the coating process to synthesize compound coatings is an ordinary modification of the process. The use of ion or electron beams, or plasma, to activate or assist the coating's deposition is also a common modification in this technique. The use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thickness of coatings can be a feature of these processes. Specific TE-PVD processes are as follows:_

_1\. Electron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate the material which forms the coating;_

_2\. Ion Assisted Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive heating sources in combination with impinging ion beam(s) to produce a controlled and uniform flux of evaporated coating species;_

_3\. “Laser” Vaporization uses either pulsed or continuous wave “laser” beams to vaporize the material which forms the coating;_

_4\. Cathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the material which forms the coating and has an arc discharge established on the surface by a momentary contact of a ground trigger. Controlled motion of arcing erodes the cathode surface creating a highly ionized plasma. The anode can be either a cone attached to the periphery of the cathode, through an insulator, or the chamber. Substrate biasing is used for non line-of-sight deposition;_

_Note: This definition does not include random cathodic arc deposition with non-biased substrates._

_5\. Ion Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVD process in which a plasma or an ion source is used to ionize the species to be deposited, and a negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to facilitate the extraction of the species from the plasma. The introduction of reactive species, evaporation of solids within the process chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses of coatings are ordinary modifications of the process._

_c. Pack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture (a pack), that consists of:_

_1\. The metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually aluminum, chromium, silicon or combinations thereof);_

_2\. An activator (normally a halide salt); and_

_3\. An inert powder, most frequently alumina._

_Note: The substrate and powder mixture is contained within a retort which is heated to between 1,030 K (757 °C) to 1,375 K (1,102 °C) for sufficient time to deposit the coating_.

_d. Plasma Spraying is an overlay coating process wherein a gun (spray torch) which produces and controls a plasma accepts powder or wire coating materials, melts them and propels them towards a substrate, whereon an integrally bonded coating is formed. Plasma spraying constitutes either low pressure plasma spraying or high velocity plasma spraying._

> _Note 1: Low pressure means less than ambient atmospheric pressure._

_Note 2: High velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocity exceeding 750 m/s calculated at 293 K (20 °C) at 0.1 MPa._

_e. Slurry Deposition is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with an organic binder is suspended in a liquid and is applied to a substrate by either spraying, dipping or painting, subsequent air or oven drying, and heat treatment to obtain the desired coating._

_f. Sputter Deposition is an overlay coating process based on a momentum transfer phenomenon, wherein positive ions are accelerated by an electric field towards the surface of a target (coating material). The kinetic energy of the impacting ions is sufficient to cause target surface atoms to be released and deposited on an appropriately positioned substrate._

_Note 1: The Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactive sputter deposition which is used to increase adhesion of the coating and rate of deposition and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputter deposition used to permit vaporization of non-metallic coating materials._

_Note 2: Low-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used to activate the deposition._

_g. Ion Implantation is a surface modification coating process in which the element to be alloyed is ionized, accelerated through a potential gradient and implanted into the surface region of the substrate. This includes processes in which ion implantation is performed simultaneously with electron beam physical vapor deposition or sputter deposition._

_Related Definitions:_ N/A

_Items:_

a. Integrated circuits having one or more digital processing units having either of the following:

a.1. A 'total processing performance' of 4800 or more; _or_

a.2. A 'total processing performance' of 1600 or more and a 'performance density' of 5.92 or more.

Note 1 to 3A090.a: _When a “front-end fabricator” or “OSAT” company is seeking to export, reexport, or transfer (in-country) an “applicable advanced logic integrated circuit,” there is a presumption that the item is 3A090.a and designed or marketed for datacenters. If the “front-end fabricator” or “OSAT” company cannot overcome this presumption, then it must comply with all license requirements applicable to items specified in 3A090.a. However, this presumption does not apply to any entity other than the “front-end fabricator” or “OSAT” company. A “front-end fabricator” or “OSAT” company can overcome this presumption in any of the following three ways outlined in paragraphs a. through c. of this Note 1._

_a. If the designer of the “applicable advanced logic integrated circuit” is an approved or authorized integrated circuit designer, then a datasheet or other attestation of the 'total processing performance' and the 'performance density' from the approved or authorized integrated circuit designer indicating that the IC is not specified in 3A090.a will overcome the presumption for the “front-end fabricator” or “OSAT” company that the IC is specified in ECCN 3A090.a._

_(1) Approved integrated circuit designers are listed in supplement no. 6 to this part of the EAR;_

_(2) Prior to April 13, 2026, authorized integrated circuit designers include all integrated circuit designers:_

_(i) Headquartered in Taiwan or a destination specified in Country Group A:1 or A:5, that are neither located in nor have an ultimate parent headquartered in Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5 of supplement no. 1 to part 740 of the EAR; and_

_(ii) That have agreed to submit applicable information described in § 743.9(b) to the “front-end fabricator,” which the “front-end fabricator” must then report to BIS._

_(3) After April 13, 2026, authorized integrated circuit designers include any integrated circuit designer that both meets the criteria specified in subparagraph (2) and has submitted an application to become an approved integrated circuit designer. However, any company deemed an authorized IC designer after April 13, 2026, will cease to be an authorized IC designer 180 days after the submission of its application to become an approved IC designer._

_b. If the integrated circuit die is packaged by the “front-end fabricator” at a location outside of Macau or a destination specified in Country Group D:5 in supplement no. 1 to part 740, then the attestation of the “front-end fabricator” that (a) the “aggregated approximated transistor count” of the final packaged IC is below 30 billion transistors, or (b) the final packaged IC does not contain high-bandwidth memory and that the “aggregated approximated transistor count” of the final packaged IC is below (i) 35 billion transistors for any exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) completed in 2027; or (ii) 40 billion transistors for any exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) completed in 2029 or thereafter, then this overcomes the presumption by the “front-end fabricator” or “OSAT” company that the IC is specified in ECCN 3A090.a._

_c. If the integrated circuit is packaged by an approved “OSAT” company listed in supplement no. 7 to part 740 of the EAR, then the attestation of the approved “OSAT” company that (a) the “aggregated approximated transistor count” of the final packaged IC is below 30 billion transistors, or (b) the final packaged IC does not contain high-bandwidth memory and that the “aggregated approximated transistor count” of the final packaged IC is below (i) 35 billion transistors for any exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) completed in 2027; or (ii) 40 billion transistors for any exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) completed in 2029 or thereafter, then this overcomes the presumption by the “front-end fabricator” or “OSAT” company that the IC is specified in ECCN 3A090.a._

_d. It is not sufficient for the “front-end fabricator” or “OSAT” company to confirm the ECCN by relying on the attestation of the end user or other party to the transaction, except under one of the three ways enumerated in paragraphs a. through c. of this note. In the absence of an attestation of the 'total processing performance' and the 'performance density' by an approved integrated circuit designer listed in supplement no. 6 to part 740 of the EAR, the “front-end fabricator” or “OSAT” company must presume that any logic integrated circuit produced using the “16/14 nanometer node” or below, or using a non-planar transistor architecture and destined for a commodity with an (a) “aggregated approximated transistor count” of the final packaged IC is below 30 billion transistors, or (b) the final packaged IC does not contain high-bandwidth memory and that the “aggregated approximated transistor count” of the final packaged IC is below (i) 35 billion transistors for any exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) completed in 2027; or (ii) 40 billion transistors for any exports, reexports, or transfers (in-country) completed in 2029 or thereafter, or where the “aggregated approximated transistor count,” of the final, packaged integrated circuit cannot be confirmed by the “front-end fabricator,” or an approved “OSAT” company listed in supplement no. 7 to part 740 of the EAR, is specified in ECCN 3A090.a and designed or marketed for a datacenter._

Technical Note 1 to 3A090.a: _The 'approximated transistor count' of a die is the 'transistor density' of the die multiplied by the area of the die measured in square millimeters. The 'transistor density' of the die is the number of transistors that can be fabricated per square millimeter for the process node used to manufacture the die. To calculate the number of 'approximated transistor count' of a die, a “front end fabricator” or “OSAT” company has two options. First, the “front end fabricator” or “OSAT” company may take the transistor density of the process node used to manufacture the die and multiply this density by the area of the die. This number may be significantly higher than the true transistor count, but if the result is below the relevant transistor threshold, then the “front end fabricator” or “OSAT” company can be confident that the die in question will not exceed that threshold. Second, to adjudicate edge cases, the “front end fabricator” or “OSAT” company may use standard design verification tools to estimate the number of (both active and passive) transistors on the die using the GDS file._

b. Integrated circuits having one or more digital processing units having either of the following:

b.1. A 'total processing performance' of 2400 or more and less than 4800 and a 'performance density' of 1.6 or more and less than 5.92, or

b.2. A 'total processing performance' of 1600 or more and a 'performance density' of 3.2 or more and less than 5.92.

Note 2 to 3A090.a and 3A090.b: _3A090.a and 3A090.b do not apply to items that are not designed or marketed for use in datacenters and do not have a 'total processing performance' of 4800 or more. For 3A090.a and 3A090.b items that are not designed or marketed for use in datacenters and that have a 'total processing performance' of 4800 or more, see license exceptions NAC and ACA._

Note 3 to 3A090.a and 3A090.b: _Integrated circuits specified by 3A090 include graphical processing units (GPUs), tensor processing units (TPUs), neural processors, in-memory processors, vision processors, text processors, co-processors/accelerators, adaptive processors, field-programmable logic devices (FPLDs), and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Examples of integrated circuits are in the Note to 3A001.a._

Note 4 to 3A090.a and 3A090.b: _For integrated circuits that are excluded from ECCN 3A090 under Note 2 or 3 to 3A090, those ICs are also not applicable for classifications made under ECCNs 3A001.z, 4A003.z, 4A004.z, 4A005.z, 4A090, 5A002.z, 5A004.z, 5A992.z, 5D002.z, or 5D992.z because those other CCL classifications are based on the incorporation of an integrated circuit that meets the control parameters under ECCN 3A090 or otherwise meets or exceeds the control parameters or ECCNs 3A090 or 4A090. The performance parameters under ECCN 3A090.c are not used for determining whether an item is classified in a .z ECCN. See the Related Controls paragraphs of ECCNs 3A001.z, 4A003.z, 4A004.z, 4A005.z, 4A090, 5A002.z, 5A004.z, 5A992.z, 5D002.z, or 5D992.z._

Technical Note 2 to 3A090.a and 3A090.b:

_1\. 'Total processing performance' ('TPP') is 2 × 'MacTOPS' × 'bit length of the operation', aggregated over all processing units on the integrated circuit._

_a. For purposes of 3A090, 'MacTOPS' is the theoretical peak number of Tera (10_ _12_ _) operations per second for multiply-accumulate computation (D = A × B + C)._

_b. The 2 in the 'TPP' formula is based on industry convention of counting one multiply-accumulate computation, D = A × B + C, as 2 operations for purpose of datasheets. Therefore, 2 × MacTOPS may correspond to the reported TOPS or FLOPS on a datasheet._

_c. For purposes of 3A090, 'bit length of the operation' for a multiply-accumulate computation is the largest bit-length of the inputs to the multiply operation._

_d. Aggregate the TPPs for each processing unit on the integrated circuit to arrive at a total. 'TPP' = TPP1 + TPP2 + . . . . + TPPn (where n is the number or processing units on the integrated circuit)._

_2\. The rate of 'MacTOPS' is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible. The rate of 'MacTOPS' is assumed to be the highest value the manufacturer claims in annual or brochure for the integrated circuit. For example, the 'TPP' threshold of 4800 can be met with 600 tera integer operations (or 2 × 300 'MacTOPS') at 8 bits or 300 tera FLOPS (or 2 × 150 'MacTOPS') at 16 bits. If the integrated circuit is designed for MAC computation with multiple bit lengths that achieve different 'TPP' values, the highest 'TPP' value should be evaluated against parameters in 3A090._

_3\. For integrated circuits specified by 3A090 that provide processing of both sparse and dense matrices, the 'TPP' values are the values for processing of dense matrices (e.g., without sparsity)._

_4\. 'Performance density' is 'TPP' divided by 'applicable die area'. For purposes of 3A090, 'applicable die area' is measured in millimeters squared and includes all die area of logic dies manufactured with a process node that uses a non-planar transistor architecture._

c. High bandwidth memory (HBM) having a 'memory bandwidth density' greater than 2 gigabytes per second per square millimeter.

_'Memory bandwidth density' is the memory bandwidth measured in gigabytes per second divided by the area of the package or stack measured in square millimeters. In the case where a stack is contained in a package, use the memory bandwidth of the packaged device and the area of the package. High bandwidth memory (HBM) includes dynamic random access memory integrated circuits, regardless of whether they conform to the JEDEC standards for high bandwidth memory (HBM), provided they have a 'memory bandwidth density' greater than 2 gigabytes per second per square millimeter. This control does not cover co-packaged integrated circuits with both HBM and logic integrated circuit where the dominant function of the co-packaged integrated circuit is processing. It does include HBM permanently affixed to a logic integrated circuit designed as a control interface and incorporating a physical layer (PHY) function._

c. Quantum control components and quantum measurement devices, “specially designed” for items specified by 4A906.a;

_4A906 applies to circuit model (or gate-based) and one-way (or measurement-based) quantum computers. This entry does not apply to adiabatic (or annealing) quantum computers._

_Items specified by 4A906 may not necessarily physically contain any qubits. For example, quantum computers based on photonic schemes do not permanently contain a physical item that can be identified as a qubit. Instead, the photonic qubits are generated while the computer is operating and then later discarded._

_Items specified by 4A906.b include semiconductor, superconducting, and photonic qubit chips and chip arrays; surface ion trap arrays; other qubit confinement technologies; and coherent interconnects between such items._

_4A906.c applies to items designed for calibrating, initializing, manipulating or measuring the resident qubits of a quantum computer._

_For the purposes of 4A906:_

_1\. A 'physical qubit' is a two-level quantum system used to represent the elementary unit of quantum logic by means of manipulations and measurements that are not error corrected. 'Physical qubits' are distinguished from logical qubits, in that logical qubits are error-corrected qubits comprised of many 'physical qubits'._

_2\. 'Fully controlled' means the 'physical qubit' can be calibrated, initialized, gated, and read out, as necessary._

_3\. 'Connected' means that two-qubit gate operations can be performed between any arbitrary pair of the available 'working' 'physical qubits'. This does not necessarily entail all-to-all connectivity._

_4\. 'Working' means that the 'physical qubit' performs universal quantum computational work according to the system specifications for qubit operational fidelity._

_5\. Supporting 34 or more 'fully controlled', 'connected', 'working' 'physical qubits' refers to the capability of a quantum computer to confine, control, measure and process the quantum information embodied in 34 or more 'physical qubits'._

_6\. 'C-NOT error' is the average physical gate error for the nearest-neighbor two-'physical qubit' Controlled-NOT (C-NOT) gates._

List of Items Controlled

_Related Controls:_ N/A

_Related Definition:_ N/A

_Items:_ The list of items controlled is contained in the ECCN heading.

_For the purposes of 4E091:_

_1\. 'Parameters' refers to any value learned during training (e.g., network weights, biases, etc.). 'Parameters' for an artificial intelligence model are also known as model weights._

_2\. 'Operations' refers to mathematical operations used for pre-training and any subsequent training, such as fine-tuning the pre-trained model, but does not include the collection and curation of the input training data. Training 'operations' should account for operations required to perform all steps in the pre-training and subsequent training process, including those for forward and backward propagation for all relevant layers, pooling, and convolutions, regardless of the implementation and hardware limitations, and applied to all relevant operations. For example, consider a model composed of a single densely connected layer with I input neurons, O output neurons, and no biases being trained with backpropagation. Such a model would have a total of N = I \* O learned parameters. Each forward pass would require N multiply accumulate operations, or (assuming floating point arithmetic) 2N FLOP. Each backward pass would require 2N multiply accumulate operations, or 4N FLOP. Then, in total, each training data point would require 6N FLOP. Training on a data set of size D would require 6ND total FLOP._

_3\. If more than ten percent of the 'operations' involve training on data that was not “published” as defined in § 734.7(a) and was generated by a single data-generation model, then 'operations' the data-generation model used to generate the data should be counted, and if the data-generation model's 'parameters' were not “published,” then the training 'operations' used to train the data-generating model should be counted as well. A single data-generation model includes variants of the same model, such as different checkpoints or fine-tuned variants. If multiple models with 'parameters' that were not “published” were used to generate data used for more than ten percent of the training 'operations,' then only the training 'operations' of the data-generation model using the most training 'operations' should be counted. No actual training 'operation' should be counted more than once, so if data-generation model A is used to train data-generation model B and data-generation model C, and models B and C are used to train model D, then the operations to train A are only added to the number of operations for model D once._

_1\. In accordance with § 734.7 of the EAR, 4E091 does not control the 'parameters' of any artificial intelligence model that have been “published” as defined in § 734.7(a). 4E091 also does not control the 'parameters' of any artificial intelligence model derived from a model whose parameters have been 'published,' except where the model has been derived using additional training 'operations' that constitute more than 2.5 × 1025 'operations' or more than 25 percent of the training 'operations' defined in Note 2, whichever is higher._

_2\. 4E091 does not control the 'parameters' of any artificial intelligence model trained utilizing fewer 'operations' than the number needed, based on the most efficient “published” methods to train artificial intelligence models, to train an artificial intelligence model as capable, according to an aggregate of widely used benchmarks, as the most advanced artificial intelligence model that has been “published” as defined in § 734.7(a) of the EAR. To provide certainty for this exclusion, the number of 'operations' needed should not decrease with algorithmic improvements._

_2.a. An exporter may determine whether an AI model falls within this exclusion by either:_

_2.a.1. Self classifying by relying on guidance published by BIS or technical opinions issued by the U.S. AI Safety Institute and the Department of Energy, should such opinions have been published, or_

_2.a.2. A classification request to BIS in accordance with the procedures in §§ 748.1 and 748.3 of the EAR._

Technical Note on “Adjusted Peak Performance” (“APP”)

_“APP” is an adjusted peak rate at which “digital computers” perform 64-bit or larger floating point additions and multiplications._

_n number of processors in the “digital computer”_

_I processor number (i . . . . n)_

ti _processor cycle time_ (ti = 1/Fi)

Fi _processor frequency_

Ri _peak floating point calculating rate_

Wi _architecture adjustment factor_

_“APP” is expressed in Weighted TeraFLOPS (WT), in units of 1012 adjusted floating point operations per second._

_1\. For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPO_ i, _performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”._

_In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero._

_2\. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor_

Ri = FPOi/ti.

_3\. Calculate “APP” as_

“APP” = W1 × R1 \+ W2 × R2 \+ . . . \+ Wn × Rn.

_4\. For 'vector processors',_ Wi = 0.9. _For non-'vector processors',_ Wi = 0.3.

_For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted._

_For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate._

_The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer._

_Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”._

_“APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”._

_“APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory._

_1\. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die._

_2\. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c, z.1, or z.3._

_A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each._

(3) Paragraph (c)(2) of License Exception STA (§ 740.20(c)(2) of the EAR) may not be used for any item in 9A515.

List of Items Controlled

_Related Controls:_ Spacecraft, launch vehicles and related articles that are described on the USML, and technical data (including “software”) directly related thereto, and all services (including training) directly related to the integration of any satellite or spacecraft to a launch vehicle, including both planning and onsite support, or furnishing any assistance (including training) in the launch failure analysis or investigation for items in ECCN 9A515.a, are “subject to the ITAR.” All other “spacecraft,” as enumerated below and defined in § 772.1, are subject to the controls of this ECCN. See also ECCNs 3A001, 3A002, 3A991, 3A992, 6A002, 6A004, 6A008, and 6A998 for specific “space-qualified” items, 7A004 and 7A104 for star trackers, and 9A004 for the International Space Station (ISS), the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), and “specially designed” “parts” and “components” therefor. See USML Category XI(c) for controls on certain “Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit” (“MMIC”) amplifiers. See ECCN 9A610.g for pressure suits used for high altitude aircraft.

_Related Definitions:_ 'Microcircuit' means a device in which a number of passive or active elements are considered as indivisibly associated on or within a continuous structure to perform the function of a circuit.

_Items:_

“Spacecraft” and other items described in ECCN 9A515 remain subject to the EAR even if exported, reexported, or transferred (in-country) with defense articles “subject to the ITAR” integrated into and included therein as integral parts of the item.

E. “Technology”

_“Development” or “production” “technology” controlled by 9E001 to 9E003 for gas turbine engines remains controlled when used for repair or overhaul. Excluded from 9E001 to 9E003 control are: technical data, drawings or documentation for maintenance activities directly associated with calibration, removal or replacement of damaged or unserviceable line replaceable units, including replacement of whole engines or engine modules._

_USML Category XV(f) and ECCNs 9E001, 9E002 and 9E515 do not control the data transmitted to or from a satellite or “spacecraft,” whether real or simulated, when limited to information about the health, operational status, or measurements or function of, or raw sensor output from, the “spacecraft,” “spacecraft” payload(s), or its associated subsystems or components. Such information is not within the scope of information captured within the definition of “technology” in the EAR for purposes of Category 9 Product Group E. Examples of such information, which are commonly referred to as “housekeeping data,” include (i) system, hardware, component configuration, and operation status information pertaining to temperatures, pressures, power, currents, voltages, and battery charges; (ii) “spacecraft” or payload orientation or position information, such as state vector or ephemeris information; (iii) payload raw mission or science output, such as images, spectra, particle measurements, or field measurements; (iv) command responses; (v) accurate timing information; and (vi) link budget data. The act of processing such telemetry data—i.e., converting raw data into engineering units or readable products—or encrypting it does not, in and of itself, cause the telemetry data to become subject to the ITAR or to ECCN 9E515 for purposes of 9A515, or to ECCNs 9E001 or 9E002 for purposes of 9A004. All classified technical data directly related to items controlled in USML Category XV or ECCNs 9A515, and defense services using the classified technical data remains subject to the ITAR. This note does not affect controls in USML XV(f), ECCN 9D515, or ECCN 9E515 on software source code or commands that control a “spacecraft,” payload, or associated subsystems for purposes of 9A515. This note also does not affect controls in ECCNs 9D001, 9D002, 9E001, or 9E002 on software source code or commands that control a “spacecraft,” payload, or associated subsystems for purposes of 9A004._

#### Editorial Notes:

1\. For Federal Register citations affecting supplement no. 1 to part 774, see the List of CFR Sections Affected, which appears in the Finding Aids section of the printed volume and at _[www.govinfo.gov](http://www.govinfo.gov/)._

###### Editorial Note

#### Editorial Notes:

2\. At [88 FR 71936](https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/88-FR-71936), Oct. 18, 2023, § supplement no. 1 to part 774 was amended by revising 9A005; however, the amendment could not be incorporated due to missing text.

#### Supplement No. 2 to Part 774—General Technology and Software Notes

1. _General Technology Note._ The export of “technology” that is “required” for the “development”, “production”, or “use” of items on the Commerce Control List is controlled according to the provisions in each Category.

_“Technology” “required”_ for the “development”, “production”, or “use” of a controlled product remains controlled even when applicable to a product controlled at a lower level.

License Exception TSU is available for “technology” that is the minimum necessary for the installation, operation, maintenance (checking), or repair of those products that are eligible for License Exceptions or that are exported under a license.

This does not allow release under a License Exception of the repair “technology” controlled by 1E002.e, 1E002.f, 8E002.a, or 8E002.b.

The “minimum necessary” excludes “development” or “production” technology and permits “use” technology only to the extent “required” to ensure safe and efficient use of the product. Individual ECCNs may further restrict export of “minimum necessary” information.

2. _General Software Note._ License Exception TSU (mass market software) (see § 740.13 of the EAR) is available to all destinations, except countries in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR, for release of “software” which is any of the following:

1. Generally available to the public by being:

a. Sold from stock at retail selling points, without restriction, by means of:

1. Over the counter transactions;

2. Mail order transactions;

3. Electronic transactions; _or_

4. Telephone call transactions; _and_

b. Designed for installation by the user without further substantial support by the supplier.

2. \[Reserved\] See [§ 734.3(b)(3)](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-07-10/title-15/section-734.3#p-734.3(b)(3)) for “publicly available technology and software.”

3. The minimum necessary “object code” for the installation, operation, maintenance (checking) or repair of those items whose export has been authorized.

3._General “Information Security”_ Note. “Information security” items or functions should be considered against the provisions in Category 5-Part 2, even if they are components, “software” or functions of other items.

Minimum necessary “object code” does not enhance or improve the performance of an item or provide new features or functionality.

The General Software Note does not apply to “software” controlled by Category 5, part 2 “Information Security”). For “software” controlled by Category 5, part 2, see Supplement No. 1 to part 774, Category 5, part 2, Note 3—Cryptography Note.

​

#### Supplement No. 3 to Part 774—Statements of Understanding

(a) _Statement of Understanding—medical equipment._ Commodities that are ““specially designed” for medical end-use” that “incorporate” commodities or software on the Commerce Control List (Supplement No. 1 to part 774 of the EAR) that do not have a reason for control of Nuclear Nonproliferation (NP), Missile Technology (MT), or Chemical & Biological Weapons (CB) are designated by the number EAR99 ( _i.e.,_ are not elsewhere specified on the Commerce Control List).

(1) “Specially designed for medical end-use” means designed for medical treatment or the practice of medicine (does not include medical research).

(2) Commodities or software are considered “incorporated” if the commodity or software is: Essential to the functioning of the medical equipment; customarily included in the sale of the medical equipment; and exported or reexported with the medical equipment.

(3) Except for such software that is made publicly available consistent with § 734.3(b)(3) of the EAR, commodities and software “specially designed for medical end-use” remain subject to the EAR.

(4) _See also_ [§ 770.2(b)](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-07-10/title-15/section-770.2#p-770.2(b)) interpretation 2, for other types of equipment that incorporate items on the Commerce Control List that are subject to the EAR.

(5) For computers used with medical equipment, _see also_ ECCN 4A003 note 2 regarding the “principal element” rule.

(6) For commodities and software “specially designed” for medical end-use that incorporate an encryption or other “information security” item subject to the EAR, see also section 3 (General “Information Security” Note (GISN)) to Supplement No. 2 to this part.

(b) _Statement of Understanding—Source Code._ For the purpose of national security controlled items, “source code” items are controlled either by “software” or by “software” and “technology” controls, except when such “source code” items are explicitly decontrolled.

(c) _Category 5—Part 2—Note 4 Statement of Understanding._ All items previously described by Notes (b), (c) and (h) to 5A002 are now described by Note 4 to Category 5—Part 2. Note (h) to 5A002 prior to June 25, 2010 stated that the following was not controlled by 5A002:

Equipment “specially designed” for the servicing of portable or mobile radiotelephones and similar client wireless devices that meet all the provisions of the Cryptography Note (Note 3 in Category 5, Part 2), where the servicing equipment meets all of the following:

(1) The cryptographic functionality of the servicing equipment cannot easily be changed by the user of the equipment;

(2) The servicing equipment is designed for installation without further substantial support by the supplier; _and_

(3) The servicing equipment cannot change the cryptographic functionality of the device being serviced.

(d) _Statement of Understanding—Used Goods._ The specifications in the Commerce Control List apply equally to new or used goods. In the case of used goods, an evaluation by the Bureau of Industry and Security may be carried out in order to assess whether the goods are capable of meeting the relevant specifications.

\[ [75 FR 36502](https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/75-FR-36502), June 25, 2010, as amended at [76 FR 29632](https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/76-FR-29632), May 20, 2011; [82 FR 27110](https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/82-FR-27110), June 14, 2017\]

#### Supplement No. 4 to Part 774—Commerce Control List Order of Review

(a) As described in EAR [§ 734.3](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-07-10/title-15/section-734.3), the EAR govern only items “subject to the EAR,” e.g., items not subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of another agency. Thus, for example, if an item is described in the U.S. Munitions List (USML) ( [22 CFR Part 121](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-07-10/title-22/part-121)) of the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) ( [22 CFR Parts 120-130](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-07-10/title-22/part-120)), including one of its catch-all paragraphs, then the item is a “defense article” subject to the ITAR and there is no need to review the CCL with respect to whether it describes the item. See [22 CFR § 120.6](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-07-10/title-22/section-120.6) (“Defense article means any item or technical data designated in [§ 121.1](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-07-10/title-15/section-121.1) of the ITAR. The policy described in [§ 120.3](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-07-10/title-15/section-120.3) is applicable to designations of additional items”). If an item is not described on the USML and is otherwise “subject to the EAR,” then work through each of the following steps to determine where the item is covered by the CCL or, if it is not covered by the CCL, and is therefore designated as EAR99.

(1) Step 1. To classify an item “subject to the EAR” against the CCL, review the general characteristics of the item. This will usually guide you to the appropriate category (0 through 9) on the CCL.

(2) Step 2. Once the potentially applicable CCL categories are identified, determine which product group within the CCL category or categories—i.e., A, B, C, D, or E—is applicable to the item.

(3) Step 3. The “600 series” describes military items that were once subject to the ITAR. The 9x515 ECCNs describe “spacecraft,” related items, and some radiation-hardened microelectronic circuits that were once subject to the ITAR under USML Category XV. Just as the ITAR effectively trumps the EAR, items described in a 9x515 ECCN or “600 series” ECCN trump other ECCNs on the CCL. Thus, the next step in conducting a classification analysis of an item “subject to the EAR” is to determine whether it is described in a 9x515 ECCN or “600 series” ECCN paragraph other than a “catch-all” paragraph such as a “.x” paragraph that controls unspecified “parts” and “components” “specially designed” for items in that ECCN or the corresponding USML paragraph. If so, the item is classified under that 9x515 ECCN or “600 series” ECCN paragraph even if it would also be described in another ECCN.

(4) Step 4. If the item is not described in a 9x515 ECCN or “600 series” ECCN, then determine whether the item is classified under a 9x515 ECCN or “600 series” catch-all paragraph, i.e., one that controls non-specific “parts,” “components,” “accessories,” and “attachments” “specially designed” for items in that ECCN or the corresponding USML paragraph. Such items are generally in the “.x” paragraph of ECCN 9A515 or a “600 series” ECCN.

(i) Step 4.a. Determine whether the item would meet the criteria of either paragraphs (a)(1) or (a)(2) of the “specially designed” definition in § 772.1 of the EAR. (These are informally known as the “catch” paragraphs.) If not applicable, then the item is not within the scope of the ECCN paragraph that contains a “specially designed” control parameter. Skip to Step 5.

(ii) Step 4.b. If the item meets the criteria of either paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of the “specially designed” definition, then determine whether any of the provisions of paragraph (b) of the “specially designed” definition would apply. (These are informally known as the “release” provisions.) If so, then the item is not within the scope of the ECCN paragraph that contains a “specially designed” control parameter.

The emphasis on the word “control” in Steps 4.a and 4.b is deliberate. Some ECCNs use “specially designed” as a de-control parameter. If an item would _not_ be classified under a particular ECCN because it falls within the scope of either subparagraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of the “specially designed” definition, then there is no need to analyze whether any element of paragraph (b) of the definition would apply to the item. One needs only review the “release” provisions in paragraph (b) of the “specially designed” definition if paragraph (a) of the “specially designed” definition applies to the item in a “control” paragraph of an ECCN that uses the term “specially designed.”

(5) Step 5. If an item is not classified by a “600 series” or in a 9x515 ECCN, then starting from the beginning of the product group analyze each ECCN to determine whether any other ECCN in that product group describes the item. If any ECCN uses the term “specially designed,” see Steps 4.a and 4.b above in paragraphs (a)(4)(i) and (a)(4)(ii) respectively. If the item is described in one of these ECCNs, then the item is classified under that ECCN.

(6) Step 6. If the item is not described under any ECCN of any category of the CCL, then the item is designated as EAR99. EAR99 items may require a license if destined for a prohibited or restricted end user, end use or destination. See paragraphs (g) through (n) of [§ 732.3](https://www.ecfr.gov/on/2025-07-10/title-15/section-732.3) “Steps Regarding the Ten General Prohibitions,” or General Prohibitions Four through Ten of part 736 of the EAR for license requirements other than those imposed by the CCL.
